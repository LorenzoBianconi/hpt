HPT (High Precision Time) is a simple kernel module that I wrote to implement
a centralized reference clock for the system in order to carry out some delay
measurements on an embedded device. HPT exploits Linux High Resolution Timers
(HRT) [http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/ols2006-hrtimers.pdf] that operate
at the granularity of nanoseconds but at the same time guarantee a low overhead 
for the system.
In order to use HPT, you need to verify that your target processor has the proper
support. For this purpose just type:

	grep resolution  /proc/timer_list

and check the resolution reported for your clocks. If your clock supports high
resolution, it will have a .resolution value of 1 nsecs. If it does not, then it
will have a .resolution value that equals the number of nanoseconds in a jiffy
(usually 10000 nsecs, on embedded platforms).
Moreover, you need to configure HRT support in the Linux kernel (CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y).

package content:
- hpt.c: htp module
- Makefile
- hpt.patch: you need to patch you kernel in order to export HPT hooks
- Makefile_pkg_openwrt: is the OpenWrt Makefile for this module

This module was tested with Linux kernel 2.6.{32-36} on MIPS 24Kc-Intel Core2 Duo
